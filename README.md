## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

Suna consists of four main components:

### Backend API
Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration. Supports both SQLite (local default) and Supabase (cloud) for data persistence.

### Frontend
Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker
Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features. (Often managed by Daytona for more complex sandbox needs, or can be run locally depending on configuration).

### Database
Handles data persistence, conversation history, agent state, etc.
- **Default Local:** SQLite database (auto-created).
- **Cloud/Advanced:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authentication, user management, real-time subscriptions, and scalable storage.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

Suna is designed for a quick local setup using SQLite by default.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure Git, Docker (and Docker Compose), Python 3.11+, Poetry, Node.js, and npm are installed. The setup wizard (`python setup.py`) can help check these.
    *   Ensure Docker is running.

2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kortix-ai/suna.git
    cd suna
    ```

3.  **Run the setup wizard**:
    *   This script will guide you through creating the necessary `.env` files.
    *   It defaults to SQLite for the database.
    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```
    *   **Key local configuration (in `backend/.env`):**
        *   `DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`
        *   `DATA_DIR=data_files` (stores SQLite DB & local file uploads)
        *   `SQLITE_DB_PATH=suna_local.db` (created as `data_files/suna_local.db`)
        *   You will need to provide at least one LLM API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) for AI features.
        *   Other cloud service keys (Supabase, Stripe, Sentry, etc.) are optional for basic local operation.

4.  **Start Suna services**:
    *   This command uses Docker Compose to build and start the backend, frontend, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
    ```bash
    python start.py
    ```
    *   Alternatively, to build images locally (if not using pre-built ones or modifying code):
        `docker compose up -d --build`

5.  **Access Suna**:
    *   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Options

Suna's backend can be configured to use different database types via the `DATABASE_TYPE` environment variable in `backend/.env`:

*   **`sqlite` (Default for Local Setup):**
    *   Uses a local SQLite database file.
    *   The path is defined by `SQLITE_DB_PATH`, which is relative to `DATA_DIR`. Default: `data_files/suna_local.db`.
    *   The database schema is automatically created on first run.
    *   Ideal for local development, testing, and single-user instances.

*   **`supabase` (For Cloud/Advanced Use):**
    *   Uses a Supabase project (PostgreSQL) for data storage, authentication, and other BaaS features.
    *   Requires `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to be set in `backend/.env`.
    *   Suitable for multi-user deployments, cloud hosting, and when leveraging Supabase-specific features like real-time subscriptions. See [Advanced Self-Hosting with Supabase](#advanced-self-hosting-with-supabase).

## File Storage in Local Mode

When `DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`:
*   Files uploaded by or for agents (e.g., browser screenshots, generated documents) are stored locally on the filesystem.
*   The base directory for these uploads is `DATA_DIR/local_uploads/` (e.g., `data_files/local_uploads/`).
*   Files are organized by "bucket" and then by their specified path within the bucket (e.g., `data_files/local_uploads/browser-screenshots/some_file.png`).
*   Accessing these files from the frontend for display might require serving `DATA_DIR` via a static file server or specific API endpoints (future enhancement).

## Authentication in Local Mode

When `DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`:
*   The system uses a default local user (`local_default_user`) for operations that require a user context if no JWT is provided via an `Authorization` header.
*   This simplifies local development as you can interact with most API endpoints without needing to generate or manage JWTs for this default user.
*   If a valid JWT is provided, its `user_id` will be used.
*   Full multi-user features and advanced authentication/authorization are typically managed by Supabase when `DATABASE_TYPE=supabase`.

## Disabled/Simplified Features in Local (SQLite) Mode
When using `DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`, certain features that rely on Supabase or other cloud services are disabled or operate in a simplified manner:
*   **Stripe Billing:** Disabled. All users effectively operate on a permissive local plan.
*   **Multi-User Management:** Advanced user roles and organization features tied to Supabase/Basejump are not active. The system operates primarily with the `local_default_user`.
*   **Supabase-Specific Utility Scripts:** Several utility scripts in `backend/utils/scripts/` designed for a Supabase environment (e.g., related to billing customer status) are disabled.
*   **Real-time features:** Features relying on Supabase Realtime (if any were deeply integrated) would not be available.

## Advanced Self-Hosting with Supabase

For users who prefer or require a Supabase backend (e.g., for multi-user support, cloud hosting, or specific Supabase features), please refer to our detailed [Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/SELF-HOSTING.md). This guide covers:
- Setting up a Supabase project.
- Configuring Suna to use Supabase (`DATABASE_TYPE=supabase` and related keys).
- Running Supabase database migrations.
- Detailed setup for other optional cloud services.
